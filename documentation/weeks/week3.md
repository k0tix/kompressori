# Week 3

On the third week I didn't have much time to play around and implement new things to the project. I did make a simple byte array data structure and switched the Huffman encoding to use byte arrays and other custom data structures. I also started planning how the LZSS algorithm will be implemented and began the first draft of the algorithm but it is'nt working or tested yet.
