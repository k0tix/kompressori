# Week 4

On the fourth week I again didn't have the time to make the project go much forward but I started implementing the LZW algorithm. I also planned stuff the project needs overall. For example one task is to make an interface (first only a cli-interface) where the user can choose and input file and the program creates a compressed version with some filename extension or uncompresses a compressed file. I might also make a simple gui if I have time for that. I also have to create custom data structures to replace the java ones.
